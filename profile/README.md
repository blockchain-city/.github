# Welcome to the BLOCKCHAIN-CITY Organization

This organization serves as a personal research and experimental hub dedicated to exploring novel blockchain technologies and distributed systems. Our primary objective is to delve deeply into fundamental concepts, consensus protocols, data structures, and various architectures within the blockchain ecosystem through the development of proof-of-concept projects.

## Vision and Mission

**Vision:** To gain a profound understanding of the potential and limitations of blockchain technology and to contribute to advancing the frontiers of knowledge in this field, with an outlook towards the feasibility and design of next-generation blockchains.

**Mission:**
* **Research and Development (R&D):** Implementing and testing innovative ideas related to scalability, security, privacy, and interoperability in blockchains.
* **Protocol Experimentation:** Investigating and evaluating the performance of various consensus protocols and associated cryptographic algorithms.
* **Prototyping:** Developing experimental repositories to validate theoretical concepts and demonstrate potential applications.
* **Knowledge Sharing (Future Goal):** In the long term, the aim is to share findings and open-source code resulting from this research with the developer community, should they reach sufficient maturity.

## Focus Areas

* Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT)
* Consensus Protocols
* Smart Contracts
* Scalability Solutions
* Blockchain Security & Cryptography

## Current Status

Currently, the repositories within this organization primarily consist of personal, experimental projects in their early stages of development. The main goal at this phase is learning, experimentation, and exploration.
